Group practice implementing UMPIRE Method, Steps 1-3. We completed Problem 2: 'Two Sum' technical interview problem.

## Problem 2: Two Sum
Given an array of intetgers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices* of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
